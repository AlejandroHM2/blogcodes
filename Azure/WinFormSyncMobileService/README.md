Using offline data sync in Mobile Services + Windows Form Client
=========
This sample application shows how to use the Mobile Service's offline data sync feature with a Windows Form client. You can follow the steps of [this official tutorial] to get started.

The only difference here is: You can't use the SQLite for Windows 8.1 extension, so you must download the SQLite dll (x86 or x64, wich one depends on your needs) from the official [downloads page], copy in your Solution and select the "Copy if newer" option.

Coming soon...

I'll update this repo with a bit more "real" sample using EF + SQLite on client app :)
